         <h3>An Enlightening Post about Gobo (also known by its English name of burdock)</h3>
         <p>Gobo has a chewy and crunchy consistency with a mild, sweet, and earthy taste similar to artichoke, but the root may also have a slightly astringent or pungent flavor. Above ground, the burdock plant looks very much like a common weed with long-stemmed, large leaves and purple thistle flowers.</p>

         <figcaption>Gobo is a good source of potassium, fiber, amino acids, calcium, and antioxidants, which can help boost immunity within the body.</figcaption>
